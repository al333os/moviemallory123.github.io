								<p>Terminator 2: Judgment Day[a] is a 1991 American science-fiction action film directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984) and is the second installment in the Terminator franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator—a highly advanced killing machine—back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor, when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less-advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.

									The Terminator was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film's rights. In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from The Terminator producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102 million budget, making it the most-expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before its July 3, 1991 release.
									
									Terminator 2 earned $519–520.9 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide, and the third-highest-grossing film of its time. Critics praised the visual effects, action sequences and cast, especially Patrick's performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, while criticism was directed towards the film's violence. Terminator 2 won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards. Terminator 2 merchandise includes video games, comic books, novels, and T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a live-action attraction.
									
									Terminator 2 is considered one of the best science-fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, as well as equal to or better than The Terminator. It is also seen as one of the most influential visual effects films of all time, beginning the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer-generated imagery. Although Cameron intended for Terminator 2 to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of sequels, including Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009), Terminator Genisys (2015), and Terminator: Dark Fate (2019), as well as a 2008 television series.</p>

					  <p>
						100% garbage!! This movie is a perfect example of how people are scared of A.I. If you look past all the death and the destruction the robots are actually quite advanced and if used properly could contribute greatly to society. I loved the action and adventure. And even though the actors play the characters very well and I really felt the emotion I feel like it was overshadowed by this distorted vision of Artificial intelligence. This movie was made by people who hate robots and they painted A.I. as this evil force trying to ruin the world. They have failed to realize that if A.I. was used responsibly then it would add a lot to society! Over all this movie did not display the full potential of A.I. in our lives. A complete disgrace to the film industry. </p>

					<p>This movie perfectly encapsulates all the reasons why A.I. poses a huge threat to society. If they had created more laws to regulate Artificial intelligence then Skynet would have never been a problem and they never would have had to build a time machine to go back and save the kid. Artificial intelligence is not some thing to mess with and this movie is just further proof of this.</p>
